__Description:__ </pre>
<pre>Problem definition:</pre>

<pre>1.The challenge of creating the donation form and the expense of creating and integrating it.</pre>
<pre>2.Hire consultants / developers for developing the forms and APIâ€™s.</pre>
<pre>3.Compliance Standards of payments and different presentations and formats of the forms.</pre>
<pre>4.Issues are mainly for smaller NPSP orgs.</pre> 
<pre></pre>
<pre>Possible Solutions (Diminished complexity):</pre>
<pre>a.Leverage SF platform to create fully API integrated donation forms.</pre>
<pre>b.Leverage SF platform to create replicable data import utility for standardized payment processor data extracts in XML, csv or MS excel EG: This eliminates the cost of integration tools by allowing the NPSP to extract and control the data extracts in the various formats.</pre>
<pre>c.Create a series of publicly meaning community owned data maps from common payment processing tools from NPSP to use and configuring the existing batch import tools in NPSP.</pre>
