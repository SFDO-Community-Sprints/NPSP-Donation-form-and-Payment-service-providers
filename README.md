__Description:__ 
Problem definition:

1.The challenge of creating the donation form and the expense of creating and integrating it.
2.Hire consultants / developers for developing the forms and APIâ€™s
3.Compliance Standards of payments and different presentations and formats of the forms.
4.Issues are mainly for smaller NPSP orgs. Possible Solutions (Diminished complexity):

a.Leverage SF platform to create fully API integrated donation forms
b.Leverage SF platform to create replicable data import utility for standardized payment processor data extracts in XML, csv or MS excel EG: This eliminates the cost of integration tools by allowing the NPSP to extract and control the data extracts in the various formats.
c.Create a series of publicly meaning community owned data maps from common payment processing tools from NPSP to use and configuring the existing batch import tools in NPSP
